**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE

## 1. The Core Mission
XYPH exists to solve the "Agentic Coordination Problem." As we move from human-led projects to agent-driven autonomous workflows, we need a substrate that ensures **Deterministic Provenance** and **Human Sovereignty**.

## 2. The Planning Compiler
XYPH treats the project roadmap not as a document, but as a program to be compiled.
- **Source Code:** Human intent, NL prompts, and formal specs.
- **IR (Intermediate Representation):** The WARP graph.
- **Target:** Verified artifacts (code, docs, deployments).

## 3. Digital Guild Integration (Squadron)
XYPH formally adopts the **Digital Guild** model to govern the relationship between humans and agents:

- **Genealogy of Intent:** Every task (`Quest`) must trace its lineage back to a human-signed `Intent` node. Agents cannot spawn work without a causal link to sovereign human desire.
- **Pipeline Ceremonies:** State transitions (e.g., Backlog -> In Progress) are formal ceremonies requiring specific cryptographic seals and validation protocols.
- **Guild Scrolls:** The output of every quest is a `Scroll` (Artifact). These are stored in the graph as content-addressed nodes, signed with the `Guild Seal` of the executing agent.
- **Consensual Labor:** The Optimistic Claiming Protocol (OCP) ensures that work is volunteered, not assigned. Agents choose quests based on their charter and capability, and consensus is reached post-materialization.

## 4. The End State
A world where "Building a Company" or "Launching a Product" is as deterministic as compiling a C++ binary. The roadmap evolves autonomously, but always within the bounds of human-defined laws (The Constitution).
