# DATA CONTRACTS
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Status:** SUPERSEDED — Merged into [GRAPH_SCHEMA.md](GRAPH_SCHEMA.md) Section 4 (Node Property Contracts).

The original v1.0 content described speculative JSON Schema contracts from Milestone 1 that were never implemented. The actual data model uses WARP graph nodes with LWW properties and typed edges, documented in GRAPH_SCHEMA.md.
